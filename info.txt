The dataset used for this visualization app is originally from the Global Health Observatory data repository on the WHO website. The entire dataset is a compilation of a total of ten vaccines: <i>BCG</i>, <i>DTP3</i>, <i>HepB3</i>, <i>Hib3</i>, <i>MCV1</i>, <i>MCV2</i>, <i>PAB</i>, <i>PCV3</i>, <i>Pol3</i>, and <i>ROTAC</i>. The following are the descriptions of each vaccine. <br/>

<li><b> BCG : </b> bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine a widely used vaccine for <b>tuberculosis (TB)</b>. According to WHO, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent that causes TB, is the leading cause of disease and death in developing countries. </li><br/>
<li><b> DTP3 : </b> DTP3 refers to a combined vaccine of <b>diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis</b>. Diphtheria is an infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and its symptoms consist of difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, and death. Tetanus is an infection caused by Clostridium tetani, and its symptoms include painful muscle contractions and difficulty breathing. Pertussis is a contagious respiratory disease that causes uncontrollable coughing. Three doses of DTP are given to one-year-olds. </li><br/>
<li><b> HepB3 : </b> HepB3 is a vaccine for the <b>Hepatitis B</b> infection, which causes liver failure and cancer. It is transmitted via blood, open sores, or body fluids. It is most commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth and delivery. </li><br/>
<li><b> Hib3 : </b> The Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine prevents the Hib infection that causes diseases such as <b>Meningitis</b> by infecting the lining of the brain. This results in swelling on the brain inner linings. </li><br/>
<li><b> MCV1 : </b> Measles-containing-vaccine first-dose is a vaccine against <b>Measles</b>, a highly contagious infectious disease that causes fever, runny nose, inflamed eyes, and other complications. </li><br/>
<li><b> MCV2 : </b> The second dose of Measles-containing-vaccine against Measles is recommended by WHO to be introduced as a routine immunization. </li><br/>
<li><b> PAB : </b> Protection at Birth (PAB) is a measure to discern the amount of newborns who are protected from <b>neonatal tetanus</b> before delivery. PAB allows programs to grasp the proportion of mothers that received tetanus toxoid (TT) or tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccination. </li><br/>
<li><b> PCV3 : </b> Pneumococcal conjugate 3rd dose is to protect young children against <b>pneumococcal infections</b> that may lead to meningitis, blood infections, and ear infections. </li><br/>
<li><b> Pol3 : </b> Pol3 is a vaccine against the poliovirus that causes the <b>Polio disease</b>. The poliovirus may cause nerve injury leading to paralysis and even death. According to WHO, this virus mostly impacts children under 5 years old. </li><br/>
